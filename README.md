# Basic-Time-Series-Forecasting
Basic time series techniques to forecast the number of visitors into a country. I compare the effectiveness of two multiplicative Holt-Winters smoothing techniques --- one with damping and one without. I comment on time series decomposition plots, residual plots and auto-correlation function plots. I completed this project as part of my QBUS2820 (Predictive Analytics) unit.
